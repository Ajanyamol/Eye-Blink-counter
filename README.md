# Eye Blink Counter (Useless but Fun!)

This project counts the number of times a person blinks their eyes in real-time using a webcam or in a recorded video file. It uses MediaPipe's Face Mesh to detect facial landmarks and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to identify blinks.

## Features

- Real-time blink detection using your webcam
- Blink detection on recorded video files
- Visualizes facial landmarks on the video feed
- Displays blink count live on the screen

## Why This Project?

While the practical use of counting blinks might be limited, this project demonstrates the power of computer vision and facial landmark detection with modern AI frameworks. Itâ€™s a fun and educational way to get hands-on experience with:

- Python programming
- MediaPipe Face Mesh for facial landmark detection
- OpenCV for video processing
- NumPy for numerical computations

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- Libraries:
  - mediapipe
  - opencv-python
  - numpy

You can install the required packages with:

```bash```
pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy
